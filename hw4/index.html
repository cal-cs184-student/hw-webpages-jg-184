		Spring constant: When the spring constant was low, the sheet was not very taught, it was a looser hold. 
		As seen with the high spring constant, the sheet was held very tightly, not draping much, especially in comparison to the low ks.

		<br><br>
		Density: With low density, the sheet was more taught, similar to the high ks scenario. I think this is because the force of gravity is lessened by the smaller weight (due to the lower density).
		With higher density, the sheet is draping in the center, not held very tightly at all, feeling the affects of gravity more. This looks more similar to the low ks case before.

		<br><br>
		Damping: With low to no damping, the sheet was almost in free fall, besides being held up by the pins, with it flopping around quickly when falling instead of smoothly like the rest of the cases. 
		With high damping, it fell extremely smoothly and also slowly.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		My implementation of collisions with spheres is as follows: first, I determined if the position was inside of the sphere, by getting the distance from the center of the sphere to the position and seeing if that was less than the radius of the sphere (inside of the sphere).
		Then I got the unit vector from the sphere's center to the position and multiplied that by the radius and finally adding that to the sphere's center, getting the point on the surface of the sphere. 
		Finally, I calculated the correction vector from the last position to the point on the sphere, and added that to the last position, scaled by friction to get the new position.
		<br><br>
		My implementation of collisions with planes is as follows: first, I determined if the new position actually passed through the plane. To do this, I used the logic that if the dot product of the Normal and the vector from any point on the plane to the point of interest is positive, then both vectors are pointing above the plane, and if it is zero the point of interest is on the plane, and if negative, it is below the plane.
		If it changed signs, this means it crossed the plane, which needs correcting. I used similar logic of ray-plane intersection to find the tangent point where the "ray" intersects the plane.
		The origin was the last position, the direction was the unit vector from the last pos to the pos. Solving for the time of intersection with the plane, I got the tangent point.
		From there, I got the correction vector by getting the tangent point - last pos. Then there was a correction, which was the normal multiplied by SURFACE_OFFSET, in the direction of the last pos. The correction vector was then added to the offset, which was then scaled by the friction, and added to the last position.

		Cloth ks differences: with a low spring constant, there is not a lot holding the cloth together, it looks like it is almost completely at will to gravity and the only thing stopping it is the sphere. It is very floppy.
		With a high ks, there is a lot more holding the cloth together, it is more planar, less being at full will to gravity, a huge difference to the low ks state. The medium state is in between, not completely floppy, but also not very planar.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		My implementation for handling self collisions is as follows: first, I implemented the hash function, where I took the Point Mass's position and used fmod to truncate them into the 3D box space. Next, I used those truncated coordinates and scaled them each by either the num_width_points or num_height_points and floored them, giving the coordinates of the 3D box.
		To generate the float corresponding to this box I multiplied the coordinates together. The map was constructed using this hash function, assigning all the point masses to a unique floating point value from the hash function.
		Finally, for each point mass, all of the other point masses with the same floating point key (3D box), if the distance was less than 2 * thickness, then a repulsive force would be applied, making it no longer clip itself!

		With low density, the cloth fell and sat on top of itself very nicely, with large folds and space in between them. It did not compress much and stayed relatively spread out.
		With high density, the cloth fell on top of itself, almost compressing itself while falling, as can be seen by the picture. At rest the folds were not large at all and the point masses were all very close to each other, representing how much heavier this one was.

		With low ks, it was similar to the high density situation where it was very squished on top of itself and was compressed heavily.
		With high ks, it was similar to the low density situation, with nice folds, and large spaces between the folds, looking more relaxed.
