		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		From my understanding, de Casteljau's algorithm is using linear interpolation to get a weighted average of each set of points on a line, then do this for all of the points in the curve. 
		We do this until we get to a single point left that is the weighted average between all of the points. So overall: <br> #1 use linear interpolation to find new intermediate points between each set of control points
		 <br> #2 Repeat step 1 until we get to a single point, which the curve will go through!
		 
		<br> For step 1, I got the intermediate points by iterating through all of the control points and weighting the current by (1 - t) and the next by t to generate the new one. We can see this played out in the examples below, the last image also has t almost equal to 1, which has heavy weight on the right points as seen in the intermediate points.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		We can extend the de Casteljau to Bezier surfaces by first evaluating Bezier curves along each row of N control points (we were given a N x N matrix of control points).
		We then get the fully interpolated points from each of these curves (the point we get when fully recursed) and then get the Bezier curve generated from those points to fully evaluate our Bezier surface.
		u and v are used as the linear interpolation paramaters (weights) for the rows and column respectively.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To compute the area-weighted vertex normals, I first had to figure out how to traverse all of the triangles connected to the vertex given.
		The Half-Edge structure was extremely useful for this. So first, I would start at the vertex given and get one of the half edges that stems from it.
		Next, we can get the other two vertices of the face by getting the next of this half edge, then the next of that one and then getting the vertices that those stem from.
		Once I am on the third half edge (the next of this one would be where we started), then I go to the twin of this, which will be on the next face.
		I started over again, and get the vertices and normals. I keep going until I got back to the half edge we started with.
		After this, I divide the summed normal vector by the magnitude of it. This results in the final normal vector weighted by the area!

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		To implement the edge flip operation, I first drew out a diagram on what this would look like. I initially did not label any of the faces, vertices, edges, or half edges, which made this extremely challenging and resulted in infinite loops.
		However, I was able to fix this by restarting from scratch and drawing out the diagram of the flip with all of the elements labeled properly. Doing so allowed me to easily change the Half-Edges where required to do so, which all of them should have their nexts be changed, but for the two on the edge being flipped I had to change their vertices, faces, and nexts.
		To go about debugging, I really just drew this out on a piece of paper to understand what elements I was updating incorrectly or accidentally overwriting (for the reason I mentioned before). I was doing things like
		the next of the edge given should be the twin's next next next. This was overly complicated and did not need to be, so I used the approach of labeling to debug and fix my issues. This was quite challenging to fix, but once I decided to be thorough and label everything, it became much much easier.

		</div>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		The edge split operation takes an edge and creates a new edge connecting the two other vertices involved in the faces of the neighboring triangles at the midpoint of the initial edge. 
		This in turn creates 2 new faces, 6 more half edges, 1 new vertex, and 3 more edges (our initial edge was cut in half, we need 3 more edges).
		In total 2 triangles become 4 in this operation. I had a lot of challenges with seg faults due to not initially setting a value of the new elements created. If I didn't do this, it would segfault every single time which took some debugging to figure out and fix.
		Being able to comment certain blocks to isolate issues was helpful as well. My best debugging tool was drawing out everything on a piece of paper and making sure I assigned everything correctly.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		For loop subdivision, I largely implemented the strategy devised in the comments on the method. First I calculated the new positions of the old vertices, by weighting them with the surrounding vertices' positions using its degree.
		Next, I calculated the new vertices positions that would be created with the edge splitting. Then, I split every edge in the mesh. To make this not infinite loop, I made sure that I only split edges that were not flagged as being new. I would then flag all of the new edges created (as new) by traversing the halfedges.
		Next, I flipped all of the edges that connected a new and old vertex by using the previously designated flags. Finally, I assigned the calculated positions into the vertices, new vertices got the positions stored in the edges they split (found the halfedge data structure) and old vertices got the positions stored in the vertex new position argument.

		<br><br>
		I had quite a challenging debugging journey throughout this part. First, I encountered an infinite loop, so I had to mass comment out different blocks of code to see which one would cause the loop. I fixed that by only splitting old edges.
		Next, I had a tough time figuring out how to designate the new positions to the vertices, especially with new vertices, this was a challenging mental problem since we already compute the midpoint, just weighted differently in the previous part where I implemented edge splitting.
		This took a while to figure out, but it actually ended up helping me detect the ultimate cause of all of my problems: edge flipping.
		I had this weird (and terrible) bug where when checking if one vertex was old and one new when flipping them, the order I assigned the vertices and checked them could not be arbitrary. Once I figured this out, I was able to isolate the remainders of my bugs. One thing I had to change was the way I assigned the halfedge() inside of each edge when flipping. This had a huge impact, so I played around with these until I got the correct flipping for each edge.
		Overall, the debugging took a lot of code rewriting, commenting, and printing out positions/booleans to determine the root of the problems.

		<br><br>
		After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges are less sharp, but they are still obviously there.
		This makes the image not look as great, especially in the case of the cube, where the corners are very obviously with each subdivision.
		However, if we pre-split each edge in the center of the square faces, we get a much more rounded and smooth looking cube.
		This helps to reduce the effect of the sharp corners, which in turn makes these images look nicer.
