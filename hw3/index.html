		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		For ray generation (task 1), we first start in camera space at the origin (where the camera is located there) and we want to look create a ray in the direction of the part of the image in camera space that corresponds to the point of the image in image space. 
		So the first task was converting from image space to camera space: I scaled the x,y coordinates by 2 * tan(0.5 * hFov (in radians)), 2 * tan(0.5 * vFov (in radians)), then translated them by -tan(0.5 * hFov_rads), -tan(0.5 * vFov_rads). Now we have a vector from the origin in camera space to the point in camera space that corresponds to the point on the image.
		The next step is to convert this vector to world space by applying the c2w (camera to world) rotation matrix to it. Finally, we normalized this vector and generated a ray starting at the camera's position in world space and going in the direction generated from camera space to world space.

		<br><br> For actually generating an image here, I took pixels in image space coordinates, then randomly sampled points within these pixels and generated rays for them applying the logic I describe above. 
		Next, I estimated the shading of the pixel by using a Monte Carlo estimator over the radiance returned by the intersected objects in the scene's normals that the ray encountered. 
		
		<br><br> To determine if the ray intersected the given triangle, I utilized the Möller Trumbore Algorithm. From this algorithm, I was able to determine the time at which the ray intersects the plane the triangle is in and actually whether or not it intersects the triangle using Barycentric coordinates. If alpha + beta + gamma = 1 and all are between 0 and 1, then it intersected the triangle and I returned the normal weighted by these values.
		I had a tough time with this problem because I was trying to use the idea from homework 1 where we intersected a plane (just in the xy plane since there was no z dimension) and then figured out what plane we were in to figure out alpha, beta, and gamma. After a lot of troubleshooting, I realized that there was a much better way to do this through the Möller Trumbore Algorithm. Moving on to intersecting a sphere, the idea was to use the equation of the sphere and of the ray and set them equal to each other to see where they intersect (similar logic to the triangle intersection).
		Luckily, lecture gave a great example so I was able to solve the quadratic equation for the two times it intersected the triangle (if it did both times) and determine if that t was within the bounds of r.max_t and r.min_t. Then I was able to find the normal to the sphere by finding the vector from the point of intersection to the origin of the sphere.
		To describe the triangle intersection algorithm in my own words, we know that we have the ray equation so r(t) = t * d + o and also the plane the triangle sits in, defined by (p - p') dot N = 0 (p,p' are just points in the same plane, N is the normal to that plane). We can use this to find the time the ray intersects the plane by setting the point p = r(t) and solving for t (we can set p' to any point on the triangle, all in the same plane, and the N to the norm of that point, it will be normal to that plane as well). After you solve for t at the intersection with the plane, you need to determine if it is within the triangle. 
		My initial logic was solving for Barycentric coordinates, as I described previously and determining if this point (r(t = t_intersect)) was in the triangle or not based on alpha, beta, gamma. I got the alpha, beta, gamma values from the Möller Trumbore Algorithm, b1 and b2 are analagous to beta, gamma.
