		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Overall, in this homework I implemented ray generation and ray intersection with triangles and spheres in the scene. Then I constructed a Bounding Volume Hierarchy for a scene to reduce the time it takes to render images when casting rays. Next I implemented direct lighting with zero and one bounce lighting. Then I implemented global lighting and used adaptive sampling to create smooth images.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		For ray generation (task 1), we first start in camera space at the origin (where the camera is located there) and we want to look create a ray in the direction of the part of the image in camera space that corresponds to the point of the image in image space. 
		So the first task was converting from image space to camera space: I scaled the x,y coordinates by 2 * tan(0.5 * hFov (in radians)), 2 * tan(0.5 * vFov (in radians)), then translated them by -tan(0.5 * hFov_rads), -tan(0.5 * vFov_rads). Now we have a vector from the origin in camera space to the point in camera space that corresponds to the point on the image.
		The next step is to convert this vector to world space by applying the c2w (camera to world) rotation matrix to it. Finally, we normalized this vector and generated a ray starting at the camera's position in world space and going in the direction generated from camera space to world space.

		<br><br> For actually generating an image here, I took pixels in image space coordinates, then randomly sampled points within these pixels and generated rays for them applying the logic I describe above. 
		Next, I estimated the shading of the pixel by using a Monte Carlo estimator over the radiance returned by the intersected objects in the scene's normals that the ray encountered. 
		
		<br><br> To determine if the ray intersected the given triangle, I utilized the Möller Trumbore Algorithm. From this algorithm, I was able to determine the time at which the ray intersects the plane the triangle is in and actually whether or not it intersects the triangle using Barycentric coordinates. If alpha + beta + gamma = 1 and all are between 0 and 1, then it intersected the triangle and I returned the normal weighted by these values.
		I had a tough time with this problem because I was trying to use the idea from homework 1 where we intersected a plane (just in the xy plane since there was no z dimension) and then figured out what plane we were in to figure out alpha, beta, and gamma. After a lot of troubleshooting, I realized that there was a much better way to do this through the Möller Trumbore Algorithm. Moving on to intersecting a sphere, the idea was to use the equation of the sphere and of the ray and set them equal to each other to see where they intersect (similar logic to the triangle intersection).
		Luckily, lecture gave a great example so I was able to solve the quadratic equation for the two times it intersected the triangle (if it did both times) and determine if that t was within the bounds of r.max_t and r.min_t. Then I was able to find the normal to the sphere by finding the vector from the point of intersection to the origin of the sphere.
		To describe the triangle intersection algorithm in my own words, we know that we have the ray equation so r(t) = t * d + o and also the plane the triangle sits in, defined by (p - p') dot N = 0 (p,p' are just points in the same plane, N is the normal to that plane). We can use this to find the time the ray intersects the plane by setting the point p = r(t) and solving for t (we can set p' to any point on the triangle, all in the same plane, and the N to the norm of that point, it will be normal to that plane as well). After you solve for t at the intersection with the plane, you need to determine if it is within the triangle. 
		My initial logic was solving for Barycentric coordinates, as I described previously and determining if this point (r(t = t_intersect)) was in the triangle or not based on alpha, beta, gamma. I got the alpha, beta, gamma values from the Möller Trumbore Algorithm, b1 and b2 are analagous to beta, gamma.

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		To construct the BVH, I first started by constructing the bounding box for all of the primitives designated from start to end. 
		Next, I determined if this node could be a leaf node by seeing how many primitives composed the bounding box (I used a counter), if it was less than or equal to max leaf size, I returned the node, with the left and right set to null and start and end set to those passed in.  
		Otherwise, this node was an internal node and we needed to split the primitives up into two parts.
		For this distribution, I found the midpoint of the bounding box I created previously, then added primitives to lists containing other primitives less than that x value or greater than (I did this for every axis).
		Then, I determined which axis had the biggest split and split along that axis, recursively calling construct_bvh with the start and end set to the lists I generated before, with the left becoming the left of midpoint list return value and the right becoming the right of midpoint list return value.
		I chose this axis since I feel like it requires the least computation, it is just a single call to midpoint on the overall bbox, then iterating through the primitives, versus some more computationally intense heuristic. A challenge I faced with this was generating pointers on the stack, which would cause segfaults as soon as I tried to render. It took a while to figure this out, but with the help of people on Ed, I was able to!

		Comparing with and without BVH acceleration. Cow: without = 2.5752s, with = 0.0272s. Banana: without = 0.6073s, with = 0.0242s.
		CBGems: without = 0.0982s, with = 0.0410s. As we can see, there is a massive speedup for the Cow (100x). There are still great speedups for the Banana (30x) and CBGems (2x), but I think with the more complex the geometry the more beneficial BVH acceleration is.
		With less complex geometry, it is not as costly to check every primitive (since there are less), whereas with larger/more detailed objects, it makes a huge difference how many times you check if a ray intersects a primitive.


		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		For direct lighting with Uniform Hemisphere sampling, I first generated a random direction to sample on the hemisphere wj. Then, I got the BDSF evaluated at the incident (wj) and outgoing (w_out) directions. Next, I transformed this vector into world space and found the cos theta of the normal surface vector and wj by taking the dot product of the two.
		After that I generated a new ray in the wj direction and used the BVH intersect method to determine whether or not the ray encounters an object. If it did, I got the emission from that object and used it as part of the Monte Carlo estimator. Since it was a uniform hemisphere sampler, the p(sample) = (1/2pi).

		<br><br>
		For direct lighting with Importance Sampling Lights, I first determined how many samples I needed per light (for point lights, this was just 1).
		Then for each sample for each light, I sampled a direction towards the light using the light sampling function. I got cos theta using the dot product of the surface normal and wj as before. 
		To short circuit this, if cos theta < 0 that means that the light is behind the point so we don't need to waste resources sampling there. We then cast a ray in the direction of wj and if it intersects something, it is a shadow ray, so it doesn't contribute to the estimator (0).
		Finally, I use the bsdf of the object (transform wj into object space) to calculate the scattering given the w_out and wj. Finally, I add to the Monte Carlo estimator as before.

		For the images generated with uniform hemisphere sampling, they appear much noisier, and look grainy. This is because we are sending light rays in uniformly random directions, with not great probability to hit lighting sources.
		They also tend to be a bit darker due to this. However, when using important light sampling, we are able to generate rays in directions towards light sources, so we can determine much more efficiently whether or not light falls onto this point (if there is an object, this is a shadow, ray the light is blocked).
		This causes the images to appear much sharper and brighter as well as can be seen above in both the bunny and the spheres.

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		For my implementation of the indirect lighting function, I first covered the base case in global lighting, if max_bounces = 0 return zero_bounce lighting. Otherwise if we are accumulating bounces, call at_least_one_bounce and add zero_bounce, otherwise just call at_least_one_bounce with the ray passed in and the depth set to 1.
		My logic inside of this is as follows: if the ray depth is above the max_ray_depth (bounces), return 0. I then calculated the one_bounce_radiance of the ray and the isect at this point. If the ray's depth was at the max_bounces, return the one bounce calculated before. Otherwise we begin the process of casting a new ray to have another bounce.
		First, I sampled the bsdf to get an incident angle wj with probability pdf. Next, I converted this direction wj to world space, and generated a ray with depth + 1, direction wj, and hit_p as the origin.
		If this ray didn't intersect another object, we are done and if we are accumulating bounces return the one bounce radiance, otherwise return 0.
		Then we call at_least_one_bounce on the hit point, calculated from the ray at the time t of the intersection. We add this if accumulating light, scaled by the probability of continuing, cos theta, pdf, and the bsdf. Lots of recursion! I had a very hard time with this part, especially with wrapping my head around what my base cases should be and how to deal with complex situations, with not accumulating bounces versus accumulating. Overall, I was able to figure it out, but it was quite a challenge!

		The spheres with the direct lighting only is very harsh and bright light. With indirect lighting, the image is much darker, but there is more of a blend of colors seen.
		Neither image accurately captures the scene but when combining them it makes a nice, well-blended image.

		<br>
		For the second and third bounces of light, there is a huge drop off in the brightness of the overall image.
		They both blend the colors of the scene, but the two bounces shows this more clearly. That color blending contributes heavily to the overall image when accumulating bounces.
		The two bounces has a much stronger impact on the image as composed to the three bounces image. This increases the quality of the image signifigantly, it looks far more realisitic, with further bounces not contributing as much.
		Compared to rasterization, the lighting looks nice, it is not just a solid color composed of surface normals/colors. It helps make a smoother image and looks great.

		<br>
		The cumulative images all look somewhat similar after m = 2 because as I mentioned earlier, the more bounces, the less signifigant of an impact it has on the image. If anything
		the m = 5 image should be brighter ever so slightly compared to m = 2. m = 1 is just the result from one bounce light, so it doesn't have that nice color blending effect we see in greater bounce images.

		There is a huge difference in the quality of these images. As seen with previous homeworks, being able to supersample drastically increases the quality of the images, even with the lower light ray count.
		Comparing sample rates 1 and 1024, the difference is incredible, but also the rendering time was a huge difference as well.

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		My understanding of adaptive sampling is that it is sampling, but it terminates once it generates a value for the pixel with a small 95% confidence interval, so with high confidence future samples are redundant and will result in the same or similar outputs.
		This allows the runtime to be decreased when rendering since supersampling doesn't require all of the samples every time, especially for simpler parts of the images. My implementation was quite simple for this.
		First, I calculated s1 and s2 as the spec recommended, then calculated the mean and standard deviation every 32 samples. I then calculated the convergence and determined if this value was low enough to stop sampling pixels. I then inputted the number of samples I took for each pixel in the sampleCounterBuffer. I kept going until I either sampled the number of samples necessary to converge or went to the sampling rate!
