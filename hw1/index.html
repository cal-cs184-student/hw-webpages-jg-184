		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		To rasterize triangles, you need to take a pixel and determine if it is within the bounds defined by the 3 points
		of the triangle.

		<br><br>

		<b>My approach:</b> Initially, I wanted to figure out how to go about this, so I just sampled every pixel from (0,0) to (width, height).
		From here, I knew I had to have a way of determining whether or not this pixel was within the traingle defined by the 3 provided points.
		To do this, I had to do 3 line tests -- I did this in a CCW direction. The lines for the line tests were P0 to P1 then P1 to P2 then P2 to P0. I sampled the point from the center of the pixel, so x + 0.5, y + 0.5.
		From here, I was able to use the fill_pixel function to color in the pixels that passed the line tests (were inside the triangle).
		
		<br><br>

		<b>Improvements to my approach:</b> The first improvement I needed to do was to account for the case where the points are given in a CW fashion instead of CCW like my code assumes (this led to an issue with basic/test6.svg). 
		To determine CW or CCW points, I decided to use the cross product of the vectors (between points 0 and 1 and 1 and 2), and the z component would tell me if the points were given CW or CCW.
		Using the right hand rule, I determined that if the z-component was negative, then the points were given in a CW orientation.
		To fix this, I just swapped point 0 and 1 to give me the CCW orientation.
		Now to improve the runtime of the algorithm. Initially, the algorithm was checking every single pixel, which was unnecessary and wasteful. 
		To address this, I only checked the pixels that lied within the smallest and largest x value (bounded by 0 and width respectively) and smallest and largest y value (bounded by 0 and height respectively).
		One issue I had with changing the pixels checked to only be the bounding box was when zooming in and out on the image, draw would sometimes crash due to a segfault error.
		To fix this, I added in the bounds of 0 and height/width so I was never accessing memory out of scope. First I got the max of the points in the x direction, then took the min of that point or width. I did the same things for x min and y values.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<b>Supersampling Algorithm</b> <br>
		First, my sample buffer was adjusted to be size width * height * sampling_rate. This was because
		when storing the supersampling samples, we have width * height pixels, which are further subsampled into sampling_rate pixels each.
		So this just adjusts the sample buffer to be the correct size.
		<br>
		Next, I go into my rasterize_triangle function. Here, I adjust the vertices to be counter-clockwise as in task 1.
		Then, I had to adjust my logic. 
		Initially, my pixel coordinate system mapped 1:1 into the cartesian coordinate system (where the triangle's vertices are defined).
		So I could just assume pixel (0, 0) had cartesian coordinate (0,0). However, this is not the case here.
		I first defined my bounding box in cartesian coordinates, then got the pixel in the frame buffer that would correspond to this place in cartesian coordinates, and finally convert that into both the supersampled buffer pixel coordinate. [Cartesian (x,y) -> Frame-Buffer (x,y) -> Supersample-Buffer (x * sqrt(rate), y *sqrt(rate)).
		Then I would do the actual supersampling. Starting with (x,y) in Cartesian coordinates, I would then sample (x + (1/(2 *sqrt(rate))) + (i/sqrt(rate)), y + (1/(2 *sqrt(rate))) + (j/sqrt(rate))), for i, j = 0 to sqrt(rate). So, we would sample sqrt(rate) by sqrt(rate) pixels for each pixel in the frame-buffer (or the case when rate = 1).
		From here, one of the hardest challenges I had with this project, which took a lot of debugging to overcome was indexing into the sample_buffer, instead of using fill_pixel I ended up using my own implementation.
		<br>
		Finally, I had to resolve the supersampled buffer to the frame.
		To do this, I essentially traversed block by block throughout the sample_buffer filled up previously and averaged the color values of the pixels in the (sqrt(rate) x sqrt(rate)) box in the supersampled buffer.
		<br>
		Additional Notes/Challenges: I also changed the fill_pixel function because the box was duplicating with drawing lines and pixels. I needed to adjust the indexing in the sample_buffer.
		I faced a lot of challenges with this problem, the majority being through indexing the sample buffer and understanding the differences between coordinate systems.
		<br><br>

		Supersampling is useful because it allows us to antialias our triangles, reducing an issue seen here with Jaggies.
		Getting the intermediate color values for pixels by supersampling allows images to appear clearer and more visually appealing overall, without the harsh lines Jaggies produce. 
		To the rasterization pipeline, I had to clear the buffers whenever adjusting the sampling rate. I also dynamically changed the sample buffer size to accomodate the supersampling samples.

		<br><br>
		Below, the same image is supersampled with different sampling rates from 1 to 16. The image with rate 1 has Jaggies and does not look great, especially in thinner corners of the triangles.
		However, as the sample rate is increased, the pixels take on more intermediate values, allowing for Jaggies to decrease and make smoother images overall!

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		With cubeman I was trying to make him wave! To do this, I had to rotate both boxes on the left arm. The first one (closest to the torso) I rotated by 30 degrees and the second I rotated by 80 degrees.
		This left the cubeman looking a little off, so I adjusted the translation to make it look good, moving down the closest and up the furthest away! My challenge here was figuring out what code corresponded to the left arms.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		In my own words, barycentric coordinates are simply a different coordinate system to describe points within a triangle (here).
		We can assign coefficients to weight the impact of each triangle vertex on the point we are currently in.
		The way I think about this is we have 
		<br><b>point = alpha * V0 + beta * V1 + gamma * V2</b><br>
		When the point is super close to V0 (vertex 0), alpha approaches 1. Vice versa for the other vertices.
		Having distinct weights on each vertex allows us to describe any point within the triangle, without using the Cartesian coordinate system.
		Using this same thought process, we can weight the color of each point within the triangle by the color of the vertices it is close to.
		Using the triangle I drew below, we know that points in the triangle closest to the green vertex are going to be more green. Using this we can assing colors nicely to shapes, for example the triangle I just mentioned.
